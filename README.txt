Define default attributes to be automatically added in WooCommerce new product page.

== Description ==

After setting up WooCommerce and defining product attributes, you can define the default attributes, as well as there order, to be automatically added to new product.

It will make the creation of new product more efficient and fast as you won't need
to add manually the attributes, and remembering the same order for each new product.

**Tested with WooCommerce version 3.3.3**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woo-default-attributes.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the default attributes through the Menu `Product -> Default Attributes`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the default attributes do not show in an already created product ? =

This is a WooCommerce limitation.

= Is this plugin kept up to date =

I unfortunately didn't have much time to keep this plugin up to date in the past year (2017), but will now find the time to keep this updated.
